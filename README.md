This was a homework assignment where I was tasked with creating a socket server and client. The server is meant to read a file and create a database from the file.
The client is then supposed to parse the DB in search of whatever license plate it was tasked with finding. If the license plate was found it would return saying
that the license plate was found. However, if the plate was not found then it would return saying it was not found in the DB.
